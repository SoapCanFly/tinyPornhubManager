## ðŸ“– Use guide

### Q: How should I name the video files that need to be scraped?

For Pornhub.com, there are currently two **_UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS_** for videos

- viewKey: Use everywhere in HTML/API, was _**CHOSEN TO BE**_ the unique identifier for Pornhub Scraper
- ~~video-id(data-video-id)~~: Use sometimes, currently _**ONLY DOING STORAGE**_

We need a rule to extract unique identifier from filename
here is the regular expression in old version tpm:

```^[P|p]h(\\S+)(?:\\s\\S.+)?```

This expression can match the following cases:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ ph1234abcd.mp4
â”œâ”€â”€ ph1234abcd-Super Hot Lily Potter.mp4
â””â”€â”€ ph1234abcd Super Hot Lily Potter.mp4
```

But, let's check out this url:

`https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=644d924a9ccc8`

It seems that the generation rules of viewKey have changed. We need to always update the regular
expression to match the new viewKey.

Fortunately, you can modify the regular expression
in `Settings -> Movies -> Scraper -> Choose 'Pornhub' -> Scraper Options`.
